Developed by Jonathan Soulsby and Kris Hayashi

Game Requirements:
A DE0-board (used as the game console), a USB cable and a power supply.
A PS/2 Mouse (A USB Mouse + PS2 Adapter)
A VGA cable

The game (Tank Hunting, a reduced version of Dual tank game) is controlled and played (or displayed)
using a PS/2 mouse, a VGA screen (640 x 480 pixels), DIP switches and pushbuttons as the manmachine
interfaces. The game is displayed on an ordinary computer monitor via the VGA
interface. The game comprises two tanks which are square boxes on the VGA monitor, one
at the top and the other at the bottom. The tank at the top keeps continuously moving on a horizontal
line on the screen. The bottom tank can be controlled by using the mouse. When the mouse is clicked, the
bottom tank shoots a bullet; if it hits the top tank, it scores one point. Once a tank is hit, it
vanishes and reappears at a random place. The score of the player is displayed on the screen. Once
the game is finished, it can be reset by pressing the reset button.
